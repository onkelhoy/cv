# Henry Pap CV
Hello and welcome to my CV, this is a project to maintain a dynamic CV that should be able to grow easily to whatever extend I want. And why not slap on my latest own framework to bootstrap it and make it even more custom! 

I hope to have at the end a tool that allows me to add final remarks like contact info, contact message etc which then gives me a pdf in return. 

If I need to extend the content of the CV then I would touch the html of course. 

## Contact Info 
email: [onkelhoy@gmail.com](mailto:onkelhoy@gmail.com?subject=Applicant%20Interview&body=Hello%20Henry!%0A%0AWe%20are%20happy%20to%20inform%20you%20that%20we%20read%20your%20super%20nice%20CV%20and%20checked%20out%20your%20super%20cool%20github%20and%20we%20are%20just%20thrilled%20to%20get%20to%20know%20you%20better!%0A%0AWe%20hoped%20to%20see%20if%20you%20are%20available%20anytime%20soon%20for%20a%20interview.%0A%0AWe%20hope%20to%20hear%20from%20you%20soon,%0AKind%20regards,%0A{name},%0A{company-name})\

## Contact content
note: it would be interessting to build a CV builder that lets me with a prompt to enter this info on the fly so it could be fine tuned to better fit the company rather then they having to define their company name, this would also allow for more custom message, 
this can also be applied to more things then the contact of course..
